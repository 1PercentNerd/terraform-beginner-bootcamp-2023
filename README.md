### Semantic Versioning :brain:

This project is going utilize semantic versioning for its tagging.
[] (https://semver..org/)

The general format will be this:--
 **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, e.g 1.0.1 


- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
